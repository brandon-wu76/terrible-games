# Terrible Games

Terrible games is a series of (intentionally) terrible or annoying games made for the "Roll for Hacking" hackathon on August 7-9th, 2020. The games include a tile swapping game, 52 pickup, and snake!

# Setup and How To Play
Once you've cloned the git repository, you'll need to download pygame. From there, run app.py and have fun!

# Config options
The display resolution can be modified in game_config.py if you wish to do so. 

# Acknowledgements
A quick thank you goes out to my parnter in these shenanigans, [Emily Bao](https://github.com/eyfb), and [Kenney](Kenney.nl/assets) for providing the cards we used in 52 pickup.
